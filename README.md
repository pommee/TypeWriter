# TypeWriter

I very much like using MonkeyType to practice typing.  
While not having much experience with frontend development, I saw this as a good chance to get some.  

The aim is not to make a copy, but to get inspiration and make my own version.  
Furthermore, multiplayer seems like great fun; so a "1v1" will also be the aim.
